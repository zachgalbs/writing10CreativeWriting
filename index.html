            <h1>What I hope to accomplish with these insights:</h1>
            <p>
                With these challenges to common misconceptions held by many, I hope to inspire those who have these 
                misconceptions to reconsider their daily activities with these new tips in consideration. Whether you take 
                cold plunges every morning, take every set to failure in your workouts or eat as much protein as possible
                in each sitting, I hope the evidence I present to you helps you gain perspective on these topics, and 
                helps you maximize your muscle growth. While cold plunging and training to failure may be fun for some,
                I implore you to use these strategies less often if your main goal is to build as much muscle as possible.

                <p>
                    Cold plunging has been recognized as an extreme way to decrease inflammation and swelling, allowing 
                    for muscle growth to occur sooner. Despite this common belief, The Journal of Physiology explains, 
                    "Cold water immersion attenuated long term gains in muscle mass and strength. It also blunted the 
                    activation of key proteins and satellite cells in skeletal muscle up to 2 days after strength exercise."
                    Cold water exposure does actually have the benefits of decreasing inflammation and soreness.
                    The way muscles grow is through muscle protein synthesis, a process which requires sufficient blood supply. 
                    Directly after a workout, your muscle protein synthesis rate is high, and having adequate bloodflow is 
                    crucial to optimize the effects of muscle protein synthesis. Cold water immersion attenuates bloodflow,
                    leading to the further decrease of the muscle protein synthesis rate. While cold plunging after a workout 
                    decreases the muscle protein synthesis significantly, I believe plunging into cold water is just as 
                    damaging, or maybe even more so, the next day. J.D. Macdougall, a popular author, revealed in his study,
                    "It has been shown that muscle protein synthetic rate (MPS) is elevated in humans by 50% at 4 hrs following 
                    a bout of heavy resistance training, and by 109% at 24 hrs following training." This evidence shows that the 
                    muscle protein synthesis rate does not spike directly after a workout, but increases past the workout into the
                    next day, furthermore showing that cold water exposure even days after a workout, could substantially decrease
                    the rate of muscle protein synthesis. In conclusion, Utilizing cold water exposure to relieve soreness after a
                    workout should be reconsidered, as it slows muscle growth.

                <p id="trainingToFailureP">
                    Throughout the past year resistance training, I have often encountered people giving advice to others,
                    saying something like, "You'll only put 225 on the bar if you just take every set to failure." or "Bro you need
                    to take every set to failure or you will never grow!" Sadly, this advice is often given to beginners like me, who are
                    easy to influence. Many beginners struggling with their form on exercises are told to work harder, or to stop training 
                    so light. Cleiton Augusto Libardi from MUSCULAB - Laboratory of Neuromuscular Adaptations to Resistance Training
                    shows that even with lifters holding an average of 5 years of lifting experience, training to failure is no more 
                    effective than not training to failure at the goal of building muscle. "This study shows that resistance training 
                    to muscle failure or non-failure is similarly effective in promoting increases in muscle hypertrophy, strength, 
                    pennation angle and fascicle length, while also resulting in similar muscle activation in trained individuals."
                    This study reveals the utter lack of need for failure training in ADVANCED lifters, the study doesn't even touch
                    on beginner lifters, who are much more responsive to training, and who don't need the higher intensity training
                    because of their lifting age. In fact, it is likely new lifters will experience drawbacks from failure training 
                    because they will accumulate extreme fatigue from their workouts, causing workouts to be harder, causing the lifter
                    to get less out of their failure training and possibly causing some workouts to be skipped, because of the fatigue
                    experienced every workout. This evidence highlights the facts that failure training is just as if not less 
                    effective at building muscle, is harder to do, and may cause following workouts to be skipped because of 
                    fatigue caused by taking every set to failure. Any new or experienced lifter who lifts to failure during their 
                    workouts should reconsider their training style, as failure training is excessive, dangerous, and does not
                    promote muscle growth any further than training normally does.

                <h1 id="excessiveProteinTitle">Protein Consumption:</h1>
                <p>
                    A couple of months ago, I was making a protein shake to meet my macro goals for the week. The protein shake
                    must have totaled something over 50 grams. It was after drinking this vapid drink I questioned the effectiveness 
                    of consuming so many grams of protein in one sitting. I believed previous to this event that the protein you 
                    consume in one sitting, no matter how much, would be stored in some way to be used later, or would be used 
                    immediately as fuel for muscle protein synthesis. However, Maria Fischer, a New York based editor, explains that,
                    "Your body can absorb in one sitting is around 25 grams of protein. In this case, “one sitting” refers to the 
                    time over the course of 1.5-2 hours" (gainful.com). This shows the lack of need for protein intake past the 25 gram
                    mark, rendering the extra protein in protein drinks and bars above that threshold useless. The use of protein powder
                    and other products can help reach protein goals for the day, but the excessive use of these products, such as multiple 
                    scoops of protein or multiple protein bars in the time span of 0-2 hours will not help you reach your goals. The 
                    excessive use of protein will not only hurt your wallet, but will also hurt you because the extra protein not used
                    by your body has to be processed and emitted, which may hurt your kidneys. In conclusion, it is in your best interest
                    to use protein sparingly every sitting because of cost drawbacks, and possible health incidents.
